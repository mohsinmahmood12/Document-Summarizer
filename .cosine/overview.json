  "projectName": "Document-Summarizer",
  "summary": "You haven't provided any specific files or their summaries for the project named \"Document-Summarizer\". However, based on the project name and the languages used, I can make an educated guess.\n\nThis project is likely a software application designed to automatically summarize documents. Given the wide range of languages used, it's probable that this project is complex and multifaceted. \n\nPython, being a versatile language, is likely used for the core functionality of the application, such as the algorithm for summarizing the documents. This could involve natural language processing libraries to understand and condense the text.\n\nPowershell, Bash, and Perl are scripting languages often used for automating tasks, so they could be used for tasks like fetching documents, managing files, or handling system-related tasks.\n\nC, CPP, and Assembly are low-level languages, which suggests that this project might involve some system-level programming, possibly for optimizing performance or handling specific hardware interactions.\n\nHTML, CSS, and JavaScript are web technologies, so it's likely that this project has a web interface. This could be a web application that users can use to upload documents and receive summaries.\n\nJSON, XML, and YAML are data representation languages. They might be used for storing summaries, settings, or other data.\n\nSQL is used for interacting with databases, so there's likely a database involved, possibly for storing documents and their summaries.\n\nMarkdown, Toml, and Lua are less common, but they could be used for various purposes such as configuration, documentation, or scripting within the application.\n\nWithout more specific information, it's hard to say more about what this project does. However, based on the languages used and the project name, it's clear that this is a complex project with a wide range of functionality related to summarizing documents.",
